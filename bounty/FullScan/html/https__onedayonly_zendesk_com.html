<p>In general, you will either be sent a One Time PIN (OTP) for every transaction, or you may be asked to enter a PIN.</p>
<p>These protocols are called Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode, and the precise implementation depend on your card type and bank.</p></div>

                  <div><p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">The short version:</span></p>
<p>We donâ€™t hold stock. Our partners deliver exactly what we need, after a deal has run. That way we keep our costs down, prices low and everybody (including you) happy.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">The long version:</span></p>
<p>We're not like other online shops with a fixed catalogue and tons of stock. Instead, most of our products never come back to our website again. Thatâ€™s how we want it, as it keeps us fresh and unpredictable (win #1).</p>
<p>So, after you (and lots of others) have placed your orders, we go to our suppliers and place a massive, single order. Our suppliers love this, as it keeps things simple and moving along smoothly. Happy suppliers equal low prices (win #2).</p>
<p>Since we donâ€™t hold stock, we can work with a cheaper, medium-sized warehouse, instead of a mega-warehouse (win #3) and weâ€™re saving lots on not needing any processes involved in handling and returning unsold stock, allowing us to offer better deals (win #4).</p>
<p>The practice of not holding stock is one of the core principles behind OneDayOnlyâ€™s success.</p>
<p>That, and our sparkling personalities of course.</p></div>

<p>Bring the documentation we have provided with you. This is important: you cannot simply drop off a parcel without any paperwork, as the store wouldn't know what to do with it.</p>

<p>Fun fact: there are more than a thousand Drop-off points in South Africa and they can be found at Shell, Clicks, Caltex, Vee's Videos, Waltons, OK Grocer, Alpha Pharm, Mr. Video, 7-Eleven and Spar. Note that not all stores participate.</p>

                  <div><p>Please proceed to checkout to find out:Â you'll find the exactÂ cost based on your location, as well as the size and weight of your purchase.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Why, you ask? Allow us to explain.</span></p>
<p>In short: shipping costs money and we don't want to go bankrupt.</p>
<p>We have debated the merits of offering free shipping at length but the reality is that â€“ without some magic source of free cash â€“ the only place that money can come from is from our customers. That's you.</p>
<p>That leaves us with two options: hide it in the price of the product, or show it. We decided to be transparent and show it. This lets us cut our prices to the bare minimum and show you the best possible savings.</p>
<p>If we had incorporated the shipping cost into the price of an item, youâ€™d pay double whenever you order more than one item but, in reality, the cost of shipping doesnâ€™t necessarily go up.</p>
<p>By the way: the actual shipping charge you pay is a best-effort approximation of what shipping is going to cost us. As a result, ordering a 3kg item to Sandton or Cape Town may work out cheaper than a 75g iPhone cover to Springbok. Donâ€™t blame us; blame the vast expanse that is our beautiful South Africa.</p>
<p>We'd love to offer free shipping. But we can't, because that means turning our company into a loss-making enterprise.</p></div>

<p>We're not trying to pull a quick one: this isÂ to make sure you don't have to pay when your prints are sent to you by the printing business themselves.Â </p>
<p>In other words, it's not shipping to get your voucher to you, but rather a pre-payment of the shipping charge to get your printedÂ product to you.</p>
<p>We haven't always done it this way, but we find that if we don't charge shipping, our customers end up with an unpleasant surprise when they process their prints and find out only then that there's more to be paid.</p></div>
